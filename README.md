The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:

Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?


What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?

Answer

adult mortality : as the life expectancy of a country increases we observe a decrease in adult mortality or death rate

BMI: individuals with lower body mass index have a higher life expectancy

hiv/aids : individuals with human immuno deficiency virus has a lower life expectancy

income composition resource : an increase in the income of individuals living in a country leads to a higher life expectancy

schooling : education has a positive effect on life expectancy in a country

Question

Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
answer from our analysis above , A countries health care expenditure has no significant effect to determine if citizens of a country would live above 65 years so increasing the health care expenditure will have liitle to no effect on life expextancy to this regard

Question How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?

Answer from our analysis above , an increase in the life expectancy of individuals in a country leads to reduction in adult mortality

infant mortality has no effect on life expectancy

Question Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.

answer life expectancy has a positive correlation with our habits we have formed

Questions

What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
answer schooling has a positive impact on correlation , from analysis eduaction leads to good income and this inturn increases our quality of life

. A country that have a high rate of schooling simply means they have a decrease in infant mortality which leads to higher life expectancy

Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
Answers alcohol has a slighty positive effect on correlation, because lower amount of alchol an individual consumes the heigher their life expectancy

Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
Answers no, population has no effect at all in determining the life expectancy of people in a country

What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?

Answers immunization against polio has a positve effect on life expectancy
